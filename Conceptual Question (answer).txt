== (Loose Equality):

This operator checks for equality after performing type conversion.
If the values being compared are of different types, JavaScript attempts to convert them to a common type before comparing.
This can lead to unexpected results, as JavaScript may coerce values in unintended ways.

=== (Strict Equality):

This operator checks for equality without performing type conversion.
Both the value and the type must be the same for the comparison to return true.
This is generally more predictable, as it avoids JavaScriptâ€™s implicit type conversion.
