In WordPress, a "post" is typically used for time-sensitive content like blog articles, news updates, or stories that are displayed in reverse chronological order, while a "page" is for static, evergreen content like an "About Us" section, contact information, or a product page that doesn't change frequently and is usually listed in the main navigation menu of a website; essentially, posts are for regularly updated content, while pages are for more permanent information.
