 The useEffect hook in React is used to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after the component renders, allowing you to perform operations based on the component's lifecycle. 

 Key Purposes of useEffect:
Data Fetching: To fetch data from APIs and update the component's state based on that data.
Subscribing to Events: To set up subscriptions to external data sources (like WebSocket) and clean them up when the component unmounts.
Directly Interacting with the DOM: To interact with the DOM directly, such as setting up event listeners.
Running Cleanup: To perform cleanup actions when a component is unmounted or when certain dependencies change.
